#This project is a responsive weather information webpage that fetches and displays real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app allows users to enter a city name and receive instant updates on current temperature and weather conditions such as “clear sky” or “light rain.” When the user clicks the button, a JavaScript function constructs a URL request to the API, fetches the weather data in JSON format, and updates the webpage dynamically without reloading. If the input is invalid or there’s an issue with the API, the app gracefully shows an error message like “City not found” or “Error fetching weather data.” The interface is designed to be simple and mobile-friendly, with a clean layout and smooth user interaction. This project is ideal for beginners learning how to use REST APIs, handle asynchronous requests with fetch(), and manipulate the DOM. It also serves as a great foundation for adding more advanced features, such as extended forecasts, weather icons, or geolocation support. With a few lines of code and minimal setup, this app provides practical experience in creating dynamic, real-time web applications using modern frontend technologies.#
